# DublinBikesAvailability
Time series modelling for prediction of bikes availability in Dublin city

Prediction models for total availability of bikes in Dublin city and a particular station (Blessington Street) are presented.

SARIMAX.ipynb -> SARIMA model for both total availability and at one station (Blessington Street)
Bidirectional LSTM model.ipynb -> LSTM model for both total availability and at one station (Blessington Street)
ML_weekly assignment_week5_PROPHET_total bikes in dublin.ipynb -> Prophet model for total availability
ML_weekly assignment_week5_PROPHET_bikes in a station.ipynb -> Prophet model for availability at one station (Blessington Street)
